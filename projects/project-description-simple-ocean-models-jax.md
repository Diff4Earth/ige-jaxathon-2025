## People involved : 
Hugo J., Marta, Sammy, Florian, Etienne, Valentin \

## Project description 
*Provide a 5-lines description of what you intend to achieve by the end of the hackathon* \
The goal of this project is to describe a common API to develop simple ocean models for feeding data inversion and calibration schemes.  
The API will be tested on different examples using different simple models for different applications.

## Background information : 
*Provide any information (GitHub repository, reference to scientific paper) useful to describe the starting point of your project*  \
[MASSH](https://github.com/leguillf/MASSH): MApping SSH repository \
[somaX](https://github.com/jejjohnson/somax) : Simple Ocean Models with JAX \
[pyqg-jax](https://pyqg-jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) : Quasigeostrophic Model in JAX \
[veropt](https://github.com/aster-stoustrup/veropt) : Bayesian Optimisation for the Versatile  Ocean Simulator (VEROS) \

## Planned work : 
*Please describe here what would be the main activities of the group during the hackathon*. \ 
0th step : Review existing librairies using simple ocean models (somaX, pyqg-jax) \
1st step : Create and develop the API \
2nd step : Code 2 models following the API and show the implementation in a notebook where you can easily change the name of the model. \
3d step : Deploy these models in different inversion schemes (i.e using Gradient and Gradient free approaches). \

## Success metrics : 
*Please provide a criteria on the basis of which you will assess whether you have achieved your objectives for the hackathon* \
1st step : Discuss the API with other users within the Jaxathon. \
2nd step : Compute one time step of two different models using the API in a notebook. \
3d step : Demonstrate the use of the API for one of the models with different inversion schemes in a notebook. \
