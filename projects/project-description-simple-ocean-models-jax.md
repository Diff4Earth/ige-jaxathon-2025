## People involved : 
Hugo J., Marta, Sammy, Florian, Etienne, Valentin 

## Project description 
The goal of this project is to describe a common API to develop simple ocean models for feeding data inversion and calibration schemes.  
The API will be tested on different examples using different simple models for different applications.

## Background information : 
[MASSH](https://github.com/leguillf/MASSH): MApping SSH repository \
[somaX](https://github.com/jejjohnson/somax) : Simple Ocean Models with JAX \
[pyqg-jax](https://pyqg-jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) : Quasigeostrophic Model in JAX \
[veropt](https://github.com/aster-stoustrup/veropt) : Bayesian Optimisation for the Versatile  Ocean Simulator (VEROS) 

## Planned work :  
0th step : Review existing librairies using simple ocean models (somaX, pyqg-jax) \
1st step : Create and develop the API \
2nd step : Code 2 models following the API and show the implementation in a notebook where you can easily change the name of the model. \
3d step : Deploy these models in different inversion schemes (i.e using Gradient and Gradient free approaches). 

## Success metrics : 
1st step : Discuss the API with other users within the Jaxathon. \
2nd step : Compute one time step of two different models using the API in a notebook. \
3d step : Demonstrate the use of the API for one of the models with different inversion schemes in a notebook.
